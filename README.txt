#purpose
This code aim to solve quadratic assignment problem using SA (Simulated Annealing) algorithm

#problem description
There are 8 departments .
There is distance between each department as well as the flow.
The goal is to have the lowest cost (flow * distance) by rearanging the distance matrix 
given that the flow matrix is fixed
This problem can be further adapted to be travelling salesman problem

#result
The algorithm obtained loss of 214.
The result is shown in "result.png".
